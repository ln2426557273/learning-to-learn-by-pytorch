# learning to_learn by gradient descent by gradient descent

Learning to learn by gradient descent by gradient descent

A simple re-implementation by `PyTorch-1.0`

- [x] For Quadratic experiments
- [ ] For Mnist
- [ ] For CIFAR10
- [ ] For Neural Art

Add:

- [x] Viusalize the learning process of LSTM optimizer.

The project can be run by this [python file](learning_to_learn.py). 

```
python learning_to_learn.py
```

This code is designed for a better understanding and easy implementation of paper `Learning to learn by gradient descent by gradient descent`.
